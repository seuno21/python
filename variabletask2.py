"""
Create a Passenger Ticket in Python

Imagine you are working at an airport, and your job is to make a ticket for a passenger.
To do this, you need to create some variables in Python:

The passenger’s name
The passenger’s age
The passenger’s destination city
The passenger’s seat number

After that, use the print() function to show the passenger’s ticket on the screen.
"""
name = "oluwaseun okuneye"
age = "20"
destination = "Baltimore"
seatnumber = "54B"


print("passenger ticket")
print("passenger name:",name)
print("passenger age:",age)
print("destination:",destination)
print("passenger seat number :",seatnumber)
